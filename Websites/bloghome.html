        <h2>2023 - December</h2>
        <p>
            Still a work in progress but since I am in a python class, I decided to make a small game. I have some of it done but not quite as much as I would like. I will focus 
            on finals the first half of the month and then we will see what I can get done during break. I have 4 hard classes next semester so I want to be ready too! "<Not fininshed>"
        </p>
        <h2>2023 - November</h2>
        <p>
            I think I got as far as I could on Mia's Coffee (found on the project tab), I have a basic understanding and did a small random color generator using my understanding of 
            JavaScript. I think it shows how despite my limitations, I can still find ways around problems. Two projects are up now, I want to have 3 projects started by 
            winter break so I can work on them without becoming too bored on a single one. 
        </p>
        <h2>2023 - October</h2>
        <p>
            Mia's Coffee is an idea I have of an online coffee shop. I know I can implement most things except for the JavaScript, because I lack the experience but I think during 
            winter break I might be able to study a bit more and come up with something. Language learning has picked up a bit but I will be taking tests this month so I will try to
            balance it all out. Right now I have to focus on school and getting things done.

        <h2>2023 - Septermber</h2>
        <p>
            Bit by bit we are working on improving our HTML and CSS skills. I am still adapting to classes and having Trigonometry and Chemestry is a bit hard but God willing we will
            make it. Just got to keep working hard! I have taken time off from learning language because I just do not have enough time to study. Hopefully later on I can continue 
            working on learning a third language
        </p>
        
        <h2>2023 - August </h2>
        <p> August update, started new classes, started working on the idea of this website. I wanted to have something to present to people when they meet me. I did 
            come with some experience because of my HTML and CSS classes I took at North Central Kansas Technical College but still, I had a lot to learn to make this website.
