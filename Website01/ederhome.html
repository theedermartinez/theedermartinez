            Hello my name is Eder Martinez, I am a student at Kansas State University, my major 
            is Computer Science. A lot of my interests revolve around programming and websites. I have taken an
            introductory Python class and have done projects using python. Those projects will soon be avaliable in the
            projects tab. I also have an Associates degree in applied science from North Central Kansas Technical College.
            During My time I took one year of IT, focused on Cisco servers and switches. I also worked on web development.
            My aim in is to use this website as not only a way to showcase my skills, but also to connect with future employers or 
            partners. Feel Free to contact me.
