                    <strong>Mia’s Spanish Coffee Dark Roast</strong> is a bold and intense coffee that captures the essence of rich, robust flavors. Roasted well beyond the second crack, 
                    these beans take on a nearly black color with a shiny surface from their natural oils. When brewed, this coffee reveals none of the green bean’s inherent characteristics; instead, it offers a dominant charred taste throughout. The thin body of Mia’s Spanish Coffee Dark Roast is a testament to its depth and complexity. 
                    If you crave a coffee that packs a punch and leaves a lasting impression, this dark roast won’t disappoint!

                    <strong>Mia's Brazilian Dark Roast </strong> is known for its exquisite blend of premium beans from the Minas Gerais region. The beans are roasted to a deep brown color, releasing their rich aroma and flavor. 
                    The coffee has a full-bodied taste, with hints of chocolate, caramel, and nuts. It is smooth and balanced, with a low acidity and a lingering aftertaste.
                    Mia's shops roasts the beans for over 24 hours, giving the beans enough time to
                    adapt and develop their full potetial.
                    Due to the complexity, this is the most expensive type of coffee we sell
